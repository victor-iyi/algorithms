"""Matrix is a special case of two dimensional array where each data element is of strictly same size. So every matrix is also a two dimensional array but not vice versa. Matrices are very important data structures for many mathematical and scientific calculations.

Numpy is a third-party C-optimized library which has extensive support for scientific and mathematical calculations. NumPy has a relatively simple API with lots of functionalities widely adopted in the Python scientific community.

For simple matrix operations we we'll use NumPy. Visit http://numpy.org for more info.

Installation:
    ```sh
    pip3 install numpy scipy
    ```

Usage:
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> a.shape
    (2, 3)
    ```
